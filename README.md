# What Do All These Words In My Terminal Mean? #

I'm learning how to use `git` and finding it quite difficult. In order to help myself
learn, I'm writing up a cheat sheet. Right now I'm just listing out the 
terms that I keep seeing and know I need to define. Eventually I'll add
easy-to-understand definitions so that I can reference this while I work.

This isn't going to be a full blown tutorial, because many people have already done 
that excellently. As the repo title suggests, this is only going to be a cheat sheet.

## Important Terms ##

- `origin`
- `remote`
- `master`
- `branch`
- `checkout`
- `-m`
- `-u`
- `push`
- `fetch`
- `pull`
- `clone`
- `add`
- `status`
- `merge`
- `stage`
- `HEAD`
- `reset`
- `.gitignore`

## Lingering Questions ##

- Why do `checkout <branch>` and `checkout <file>` seem to do such different things?
- Why is `HEAD` in all caps?
